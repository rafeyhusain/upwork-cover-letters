Hello and Good Morning,

My name is Rafey, and I’m a Full Stack Software Engineer with deep experience in the crypto SocialFi industry. I was the lead developer of Crypto website PopSocial.io and its associated $PPT token mobile and web apps. This platform combined decentralized social networking with tokenized rewards, and involved smart contract integrations, tokenomics, and crypto wallet connectivity.

For PopSocial, I built:

- A multi-platform app (React + React Native)

- Web3 wallet integration

- Presale and token distribution mechanisms

- Secure smart contract interactions

- Auto-allocation and dashboard features for both creators and users

Your project aligns directly with my expertise. I can deliver a clean, responsive, and high-conversion website for your meme token, implement USDT swap mechanics, and set up auto-allocation logic tied to your token’s smart contract.

With over 27 years of experience delivering high-performance SaaS platforms across fintech, AI, healthcare, and enterprise sectors. I specialize in TypeScript, React/React Native, .NET, PostgreSQL, and modern AI integrations, and I thrive when working directly with founders to turn vision into robust, production-grade systems.

Over the years, I’ve built and scaled multiple SaaS platforms. For example,

- GET ERP – ERP/CRM middleware for retail (React/.NET)

- ApexChat – Real-time chat SaaS with WebRTC (React/.NET)

- PopSocial – Crypto social platform (React/Spring Boot/AWS)

- TradeSun – AI-powered trade finance SaaS (React/Node.js/AWS)

- AARP MoneyMap – Personal finance management SaaS (React/GraphQL/Apollo/AWS)

- SmallWorld – International money transfer system (React/Spring Boot/AWS)

- TaksQue – Project management SaaS (Laravel/AWS)

I have also built AI, Data, and Analytics platforms. For example,

- SCEAI – Qatari government AI & analytics portal (Next.js/.NET/Azure AI)

- RAG Q&A System – Python-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation system using Hugging Face and Google FLAN-T5

- SeaWingAI.com – Designed and delivered a dozen AI-driven products including RAG pipelines, AI agents, and data visualizations

- Telehealth AI MCP – A Claude-based desktop app integrated with FastAPI REST backend, summarizing 600+ page PDFs for diagnosis and treatment insights

I’m fluent with tools like Prisma, Vercel, Stripe, OpenAI APIs, LangChain, FAISS, Hugging Face, and Azure OpenAI. I write clean, modular, and well-documented code, move fast, and deliver results with clarity and accountability.

If you're looking for someone who can ship fast, work closely with founders, and has proven crypto project delivery, I’d love to connect.

Best regards,
Rafey
