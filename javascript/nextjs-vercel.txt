Hello and Good day,

My name is Rafey. I am Full Stack Software Engineer with wide skillset. I have 27+ years of experience developing and scaling SaaS platforms using TypeScript, React/NextJs, Node, MongoDB, and multi-tenant PostgresSQL with AI integrations.

I delivered a production-ready AI SaaS dashboard using Next.js (App Router), React Server Components, and Vercel AI SDK integrated with OpenAI APIs for intelligent assistant workflows.

I’m comfortable working in lean environments and have used Cursor for rapid prototyping and deployment in all of my projects. My backend expertise includes Neon PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM, and Vercel Functions for performant APIs. I’ve also built user-facing features such as AI chat UIs, file uploads, memory-integrated prompts, and subscription systems using Stripe. For example,

TypeScript systems I built are:

1. GET ERP SaaS (ERP/CRM middleware SaaS for retail industry. Used Angular)
2. ApexChat Realtime Chat SaaS (B2C Chat SaaS. Used React)
3. SCEAI Qatari AI, Data and Analytics Portal (B2G BI Portal. Used NextJs/React) 

Let’s discuss how I can contribute to building a robust backend. I’m ready to start right away.

I’ve architected and modularized large-scale Node.js applications across healthcare, fintech, and cloud SaaS. For Example,

1. TaksQue SaaS (A project management SaaS platform. Used AWS/Laravel)
2. PopSocial (A Crypto SasS. Used React/AWS/Springboot)
3. TradeSun (AI powered Trade Finance SaaS. Used React/AWS/NodeJS)
4. AARP MoneyMap (A personal finance SaaS. Used React/AWS/Apollo Client/Apollo Server/GraphQL)
5. SmallWorld (A money transfer SaaS. Used React/AWS/Springboot)

I have extensively worked on Python, RAG, AI Agentic Systems, MCP, pyTorch, Azure Open AI Service, LangChain, FAISS, AI Vector Databases, Stack AI, AI Chatbots using Botpress. I have worked on Telehealth AI, RAG and MCP systems. For Example,

1. SCEAI Qatari AI, Data and Analytics Portal (B2G BI Portal. Used Azure AI/.NET) 
2. RAG Q&A System (Python, Hugging Face, Google Flan T5)
3. Designed around a dozen AI products at AI consultancy SeaWingAI.com
4. I have built a Claud Desktop-based MCP for FastAPI REST backends for a telehealth platform for Appedology Pvt. Ltd. Doctors could upload 600+ pages of PDF and the AI pipeline generates summaries, medical issues, medication, procedure details, etc. The MCP Agent on top of the REST API helps doctors to use the Claud Desktop to research patient conditions like Vitamins, Symptoms, etc.

I thrive when working directly with founders to turn vision into reality through system thinking and well-documented code. I’d love to help you ship a lightweight, AI-powered platform that users love.

Let’s connect to discuss how I can contribute from day one.

Warm regards,
Rafey
