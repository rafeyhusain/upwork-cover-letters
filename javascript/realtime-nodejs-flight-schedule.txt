Hello and Good day,

My name is Rafey. I have 27+ years of experience developing and scaling SaaS platforms using TypeScript, React, Node, MongoDB, and MySQL with AI integrations.

I have built a real-time New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) dashboard for OfficeField using Node.js, Socket.IO/WebSockets, Redis, React to stream live ticker data with sub-second latency. This experience directly aligns with your project’s core requirement to build a real-time flight management system that tracks and displays up-to-the-minute information on flights, delays, and passengers.

For your project, here’s the approach I would take suggested Tech Stack:

Backend: Node.js with Express.js – fast, scalable, and event-driven for real-time use

WebSockets / Socket.IO: For pushing live updates to the dashboard without manual refresh

Redis: For caching frequent real-time data like flight statuses and delay metrics

Frontend: React.js with charting libraries (Recharts or D3.js) for interactive dashboards

Database: PostgreSQL (relational, great for handling structured data like passengers, flight logs)

Integration: FlightAware or FlightRadar24 API (for live flight data)

Authentication: JWT or OAuth2 (if required for role-based access)

Deployment: Dockerized microservices hosted on AWS (EC2 + RDS + CloudWatch)

Key Features I’ll Deliver:

A live dashboard showing all flights scheduled by day with color-coded statuses (on-time, delayed, landed)

Inbound flight monitoring, including prior flights (causing cascading delays)

Passenger drill-down, with uploads by flight/time and delay impact tracking

Summaries: Total passengers landed, in-air, missed connections, and incidents

Fully responsive UI with a smooth UX for operators

I understand the aviation space is highly sensitive to timing, precision, and system reliability. My experience building high-performance real-time systems and dashboards for stock markets can translate effectively into your operational needs for flight tracking and management.

Let’s discuss the next steps or feel free to send a smaller scope for proof of capability.

Looking forward to collaborating with you.


Looking forward to hearing from you.

I would be very happy to help you out with your vision.

Warm regards,
Rafey
