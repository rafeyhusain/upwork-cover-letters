Hello and Good day,

My name is Rafey. I am Senior Software Architect. I have 27+ years of experience in architecting and scaling Microsoft .NET and Azure/AWS SaaS platforms.

I have extensively worked on .NET, .NET Core, .NET MVC and Azure. I have worked on dozens of systems with Azure Functions, App Services, Logic Apps, Key Vault and Azure SQL API. For example,

1. GET ERP SaaS (ERP/CRM middleware SaaS for retail industry. Used Azure/.NET)
2. ApexChat Realtime Chat SaaS (B2C Chat SaaS. Used .NET at backend)
3. SCEAI Qatari AI, Data and Analytics Portal (B2G BI Portal. Used Azure/.NET) 

I am throughly experienced in Microservices, Distributed Systems, Event-Driven Design, and Scalable Infrastructure. Including Cloud & DevOps – AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD, and Serverless Computing.

Let’s discuss how I can contribute to building a robust backend. I’m ready to start right away.

I’ve architected and modularized large-scale Node.js and Python applications across healthcare, fintech, and cloud SaaS. For Example,

1. TaksQue SaaS (A project management SaaS platform. Used AWS/Laravel)
2. PopSocial (A Crypto SasS. Used AWS/Springboot)
3. TradeSun (AI powered Trade Finance SaaS. Used AWS/NodeJS)
4. AARP MoneyMap (A personal finance SaaS. Used AWS/Apollo Client/Apollo Server/GraphQL)
5. SmallWorld (A money transfer SaaS. Used AWS/Springboot)

Looking forward to hearing from you.

I would be very happy to help you out in resolving your issues.

Warm regards,
Rafey
