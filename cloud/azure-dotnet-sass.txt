Hello and Good day,

My name is Rafey. I have 27+ years of experience in developing and scaling Microsoft .NET and Azure SaaS platforms.

I have extensively worked on .NET, .NET Core, .NET MVC and Azure. I have worked on dozens of systems with Azure Functions, App Services, Logic Apps, Key Vault and Azure SQL API. For example,

1. GET ERP SaaS (ERP/CRM middleware SaaS for retail industry. Used Azure/.NET)
2. ApexChat Realtime Chat SaaS (B2C Chat SaaS. Used .NET at backend)
3. SCEAI Qatari AI, Data and Analytics Portal (B2G BI Portal. Used Azure/.NET) 

Let’s discuss how I can contribute to building a robust backend. I’m ready to start right away.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

I would be very happy to help you out in resolving your issues.

Warm regards,
Rafey
