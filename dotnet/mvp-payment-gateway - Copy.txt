Hello and Good day,

My name is Rafey. I have 27+ years of experience in architecting and scaling Microsoft and .NET platforms which is required for your greenfield Payment Gateway Services MVP. With software development experience, including deep expertise in .NET Core, microservices architecture, and identity management systems like KeyCloak, Azure B2C, AWS Cognito, Auth0, I am confident in my ability to contribute meaningfully to the success of this project.

Throughout my career, I have designed and implemented secure, modular, and scalable backend systems across financial, AI, and SaaS domains. I have built microservices for transaction processing, authentication, onboarding flows, and real-time reporting. My hands-on experience with ASP.NET Core Identity, OAuth2, OpenID Connect, MSSQL, RabbitMQ, Kafka, and MySQL makes me a strong fit for this role’s technical demands.

I’m a seasoned C# .NET developer with deep expertise in CICD, especially in the context of financial platforms. I believe I can bring immediate value to your project based on my proven experience in building scalable and secure systems. For example,

I am thoroughly experienced in Microservices, Distributed Systems, Event-Driven Design, and Scalable Infrastructure. Including Cloud & DevOps – AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD, and Serverless Computing.

Let’s discuss how I can contribute to building a robust backend. I’m ready to start right away.
